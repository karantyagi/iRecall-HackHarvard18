# `iRecall`
## An intelligent memory and recall management app for humans - give you the best way to memorize stuff.
---
### Building real time web app @ HackHarvard
### Curing the transience sin of memory

---

* repetition is the mother of all skills (5 reviews)
* memory is perfect, recall is fallabile.


Formalizing the problem - 
Brainstorming rubric:
* What do we ideally want ? How an ideal Iron-man movie type system behave ?
* what can be built ?
* what can be built as a demo app showing all functionality ?

__Goal : __ A demo app demonstrating how a real time system would behave 

`Live link to app : _____ ` 

__Presentation goal :__ pitch as if this were to be full fledged startup app

`2 youtube videos : Demo app at HackHarvard - shoot and post youtube video - demo presentation + a video of prototype` 

__Interview Goal__ : know system architecture + modules + demo app with scalable architecture + plug in extension
* design should be SOLID + OOD + incorporate DB + MSD learnings {demonstarte this in the interview}
* keep clicking pics during brainstorming phase & add to archiecture folder 
* Your contribution ?? {keep recording} - architecture, recall algorithm + xyz module + SQL queries + backend data models + _frontend UI ??_
* challenges + technical challenges + fixes
* learning + takeaway from project ? How to design for scalability ? SOLID + loose couple + independent modules + DI , IoC
* Design decisions for Tech stack - why MongoDb over Spring JPA or vice-versa
* (moduarity) + loosely coupled system + make parameters like 1st review time, 2nd review time etc as independent dependencies 
to the recall algorithm - that will help u make the demo work - as you will scale down 30 days to 7 months and accordingly..

__Personal Goals__ : add to devpost + linkedIn post + project + update resume & your personal website + 
prepare fully for an interview discussion __[do all this as a part of the final demo presentation]__

### `be careful about working in your repo + integrating pull requests + integrating the system + some commits from your side`


{ideally unstructured data, but put lot of constraints for handling } - memorized stuff(notes) type - single answer facts, abbreviations, FB, multiple points for concept with 
concepts (notion of keyword highlighting + similarity of two text algo + insights from how plagarism detectors work 
- answer should be as plagarized as possible) (Correctness %)

Add some basic visualization after retrieveing some queries - like a dashboard or simple list facts :
* day's recall
* incorporate short term, long term 
* something catchy - dashboard + Bot type conversational UI like google assistant;
